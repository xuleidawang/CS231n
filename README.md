# CS231n Assignments Repo
This is my repo for self studying the course [Stanford CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html). 

## Setup Instructions
### Work Locally
**Install Anaconda:**
**Anaconda Virtual environemtn:**
Once have Anaconda installed, it makes sense to create a virtual environment for the course. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run (in a terminal)
```conda create -n cs231n python=3.7 anaconda```  
to create an environment called ```cs231n```.  
To acitivate and enter the environment, run  
``` conda activate cs231n```

To exit, close the window or run  
```conda deactivate cs231n```
